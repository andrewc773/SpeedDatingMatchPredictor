    "<p style=\"font-size: 17px\">Speed dating is a formalized matchmaking process where two groups of single participants \"date\" each other for a short period of time, in round-robin fashion. For each date, each participant must decide whether or not they would like to see the other party in the future. If both say \"Yes\",\n",
    "then there is a match. </p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size: 17px\">Assembled by Columbia Business School professors, Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar, our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment\">dataset</a> holds data for speed dating events from 2002-2004. Each participant was required to enter information about themselves, such as age, school of undergraduate degree, and occupation. They were asked to rate (on a scale of 1-10 or 1-100) what they valued most in a partner. At the end of each date, they were also asked to rate the attributes of their partner on an individual level. Each date was between members of the oppposite sex. There were no entries from same-sex groups.</p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size: 17px\">In this tutorial, our goal is to find trends in our data, especially comparing the two groups: men and women. By the end of the tutorial, we will have composed a Machine Learning model using a Decision Tree classification algorithm. We hope that by the end of this tutorial, you will have a better understanding of how and why one should handle null entries in a dataset, hypothesis testing, how to create an ML model with SKLearn, and how to evaluate the performance of such a model. </p>"

With hyperparameters, it is important to tune them to reach acceptable rates of performance. Unfortunately, tuning hyperparameters is not an exact science and can require trial-and-error.

    "<p style=\"font-size: 17px\">Dating and romance can seem complicated and confusing. Using data science, my hope was that this exploration would make the dating world easier to understand. Obviously, love is more complex than numbers, and it is difficult to capture what makes two people click, when everyone is so different. That said, our ML model was able to create a prediction that was better than 50/50 guessing when predicting if someone would like to see another person again or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size: 17px\">So what should someone take away from our findings? It is noting that whether a match existed, or if the other person said, \"yes\", too, were hands-down the best predictors of a \"Yes\" or a \"No\". It perhaps suggests that people are able to read each other and have an intutive sense of whether or not they get along with someone else. If you were ever unsure of your relationship standing with someone else, or had a bad date experience with them, then chances are, they may felt the same way. And the same goes for positive experiences. Our findings do allude to differences in dating preferences between men and women too. There are several other studies exploring the differences, and our findings do seem to fit those of the other studies, such as larger emphasis placed on phyiscial attractiveness for men as opposed to women.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size: 17px\">Our exploration has much room for improvement. There are several different factors that are still left to explore, such as relationships between matches and differences in intellgience or income. As for rigorous statistical analysis, one should keep in mind to control for other variables to make their findings as precise and accurate as possible. Machine learning can be a powerful tool for reading social dynamics, but newer, fuller, datsets are hopefully available in the near future so we can try and make sense of the world through the patterns and relationships they reveal to us."
